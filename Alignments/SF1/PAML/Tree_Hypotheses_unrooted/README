T0 analysis for hypothesis that all branches have the same rate
T1 analysis for hypothesis that CPI&TSC and GIN branches each have separate rates that are distinct from the rest of the tree
T2 analysis for hypothesis that STR and CMY branches each have separate rates that are distinct from the rest of the tree
T3 analysis for hypothesis that CIN and PSI&ASP branches each have separate rates that are distinct from the rest ofthe tree
T4 analysis for hypothesis that PEX and EMA branches each have separate rates that are distinct from the rest of the tree
TN1 null for T1 results. CPI, TSC, and GIN all have a separte rate from the rest of the tree
TN2 null for T2 results. STR and CMY all have a separate rate from the rest of the tree
TN3 null for T3 results. CIN, PSI, and ASP all have a separate rate from the rest of the tree
TN4 null for T4 results. PEX and EMA all have a separate rate from the rest of the tree
CPIASP analysis for hypothesis that CPI and ASP branches each have separate rates that are distinct from the rest of the tree
CPI null for CPIASP results. CPI and ASP all have a separate rate from the rest of the tree
GSD analysis for hypothesis that TSD --> GSD transition branches have a separate rate from the rest of the tree
AM_GG directory contains analyses for outgroups versus turtle lineages.

Each directory contains a .ctl file with parameters for the codeml run, a tree.txt file which represents the hypothesis for the analysis, and a .phylip file wich contains the alignment of 10 turtles, alligator, and chicken.

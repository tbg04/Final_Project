1. aligned CDS sequences with mafft --auto --phylipout parameters

2. Test if there is enough seqeunce divergence. I tested with RAxML to see if polytomies were produced.
Ther were no polytomies, however the gene tree was discordant with the species tree.

raxmlHPC -m GTRGAMMA -p 12345 -# 20 -s file.phylip -n T1 #generates ML trees using 20 different starting trees
raxmlHPC -m GTRGAMMA -p 12345 -b 12345 -# 100 -s file.phylip -n T2 #bootstrapping
raxmlHPC -m GTRCAT -p 12345 -f b -t RAxML_bestTree.T1 -z RAxML_bootstrap.T2 -n T3 #draw bipartitions on the tree
raxmlHPC -m GTRCAT -J MR -z RAxML_bootstrap.T2 -n T4 #majority rule tree

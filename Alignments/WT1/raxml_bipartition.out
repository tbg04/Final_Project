         Notes: RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) is a program for sequential and parallel Maximum Likelihood based inference of large phylogenetic trees. It can also be used for post-analysis of sets of phylogenetic trees, analysis of alignments and, evolutionary placement of short reads. This module contains the mpi executables along with the pthread executables. They are named accordingly.
